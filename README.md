# ChitChattApp
Client: React JS

Server: Node JS, Express JS

Database: Mongo DB
This repository contains the code for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) chat application. The app utilizes various technologies such as Node.js, React, Socket.io, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.

The frontend of the application is built using React.js. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chat features. Socket.io is used for real-time communication between the server and the client, enabling instant messaging capabilities.

For authentication and authorization, the app implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The backend, developed with Node.js, includes multiple APIs that handle various functionalities and are seamlessly integrated with the frontend.

This project showcases the implementation of a chat application with a MERN stack, demonstrating the usage of modern technologies and best practices for building robust and scalable web applications.

Key Features:

Real-time messaging using Socket.io
User authentication and authorization with JWT
Multiple APIs for different functionalities
React.js frontend for a seamless user experience
